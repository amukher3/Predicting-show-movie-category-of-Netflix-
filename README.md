### Predicting the category of the show/movie in Netflix from the short description 

This is an effort to predict the category of the movie/show in Netflix from its given description. 
In this problem I have tried to predict the category of the movie or the show from the given short
description which basically tries to summarize the show. 
This effort runs parallel to text summarization albeit it tries to summarize the text in a different
way and in some ways is more similar to text classification techniques than text summarizatoin. 

The model achives very high train,test and validation accuracies of more than 95% and can be easily deployed 
in a web UI based framework or in a android based framework using TensorFlow. 

The final model is a feed forward neural network which works on the embedded vectors.
